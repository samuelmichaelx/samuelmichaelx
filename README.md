 I just finished the ALX Professional Foundation program and it made a better problem solver, and an expect with Google workspace. 
- I am into the Data science program now, where I am honing my Data Analytics, Python, SQL, Machine learning, and even Cloud Coputing Skills. I am also a bit founder enthusiast, so I am into the ALX Founders Academy. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on startup data projects especially in data engineering and web-scrappping.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking to help with any form of data analytics and data visualization projects
- You can connect with me on LinkedIn or send me an email
-  Fun fact: I think in my head, I am a better singer than the lead sing for The CranberriesðŸ˜‚
